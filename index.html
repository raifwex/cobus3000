boarded a flight at O'hare and walked to the back left aisle. i stuffed my blanket far under my seat and opted out of the mini pretzels. got fresh orange juice at the airport and took taxi to the bed and breakfast (pictured above). walked through the neighborhood of Gràcia with tight corridors and .90€ espresso. we accidently made it all the way to park guell where we watched selfie sticks pop out and overheard mostly english speakers. walked back and enjoyed the porch before tapas. didn't fall asleep until sometime after 11 to work through the jet lag.

    woke up early for a great breakfast of pastries, cured meats, manchego cheese, orange juice and pan con tomate before making the long walk towards the Museu del Disseny (Design Museum). stopped on the way at an herbalist for pure rosehip oil, a large indoor market to look around, and a stand for coffee. after continuing again down the Avenida Diagonal, we walked by the swarmed Casa Batlló and watched everyones chaotic group pictures before taking refuge in the alcove of a nearby spy store. we crossed one last busy avenue to get the the museum and started bottom to top in a vestibule with huge ceilings. as we progressed, the floors went from common objects to silhouettes and fashion. the headboard below was one of my favorite things along with the 1992 Olympics mascot, Cobi. tickets for the museum were 4€ and i walked through the library afterward before posting up on the terrace.

  <p style="max-width: 50em;">
    leaving the museum, we walked towards the Torre Glòries building next door which reminded me of The Gherkin in London. went through gran clariana park where some of the chairs were a lot taller than others and towards Sagrada Familia. we sat for a while in the park right nearby and admired the melting basilica and the crowds it drew. there was a man performing expressive dance in a wheelchair working up and down a lot of the closed off street.

<p style="max-width: 50em;">
repeated yesterdays breakfast and hunted for a SIM card. this included a trip to Mediamarkt where they had a big TV's that had nice animations playing on them. downstairs there were big fridges with Samsung brand cheese and cookies. visited a department store across the street still without a SIM card. checked into a new hotel that afternoon and spent a lot more time walking around the tighter cobblestone streets in Ciutat Vella. passed by a cafe called Ginger which i bookmarked in my brain for later. it looked like a ship galley with green lights and tight spiral stairs but lots of seating in a small square outside. after navigating a bit more we ended up at a store called Doshaburi which was the best shopping we encountered in the whole city. it was a tiny unmarked store front overflowing with boxes and velvet hangers with a man named Yoshimitsu sitting outside. we spent some time with him and he shared his personal experiences in fashion ventures, stock rooms, and growing up in Japan, speaking of the products he sold as much more of a lifestyle than anything else.

<p style="max-width: 50em;">
  breakfast was spent in the courtyard of the hotel before going down to the water nearby and admiring all of the Russian yachts docked there. they were next to a mall that had VR racing with the car seats and everything. the whole dock took a long time to walk around and lead towards a nice view of a nearby mountain where gondola cars runs to. i found a SIM card at a LED covered phone store that sold phone cases with phrases like "Pablo Escobar is calling". it was on the way to La Boqueria where they made little smiling marzipan treats. there was a crazy amount of Iberian ham here. had a good empanada and chocolate before continuing the walk towards El Pobre Sec.

        <p style="max-width: 50em;">
          the heat caused us to take primarily side streets on the way because the shade was better there. passed by many different haircut styles and supermarkets in El Raval which is Arabic for "suburbs". some thick trees with ancient tumors greeted us towards the entrance of Palau Nacional de Montjuic and it's grand steps. right beyond the ornamentation was Mies Van Der Rohe's intensely simple Barcelona Pavilion with 4€ student tickets. it was almost entirely empty both in furnishings and guests which added to the stark marble atmosphere.
        <img src="june9.0.jpg" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;" width=500>
        <p style="max-width: 50em;">
          after the pavilion we spent an incredible amount of time trying to rent Barcelona's City Bike equivilent called Bici. i filled everything out before realizing i don't have a DNI number because i'm not a european born citizen. got back to the hotel by alternative methods and spent the night in the rooftop pool.
        </p>

<p style="max-width: 50em;">
    had another breakfast in the courtyard before checking out and going back to BCN. had a flight to Mallorca that was so short i barely had time to put my head in my lap before the 15 minutes until landing warning. got there, got in a taxi, loosely fumbled in Spanish, arrived in familiar cobblestone winding streets. they were even smaller than before and the driver could zip by people that had to stand still for him to pass. we checked in after passing through a courtyard out of Verona in Romeo and Juliet. the stone stairs were very very worn to the point of having small dips in the middle and we got to our room with floor to ceiling doors that opened on the busy street below before exploring the building. the home owners, Francesco and Sebastian, showed us through their apartment (which was featured in an interior design book called Simply Contemporary) and had been stuck in time from a hand crafted era. books and wooden furniture with religious embelishings were stuck to every surface and it felt surprising to see that there was even working electricity.

            <p style="max-width: 50em;">
              went through a maze of empty or completely cluttered rooms and stair cases to make it to the roof and see the view of Palma Cathedral just two roof tops over. after coming down we walked through the city for the first time, got good empanada, smelled nice baby perfume, and had gelato.
            </p>

<p style="max-width: 50em;">
    on Saturday, we heard some birds and bunnies in noisy cages that were too small from the street on the way to Cafè Riutort. had one of my favorite breakfasts there and made it to Es Baluard Museu d'Art Contemporani de Palma (Museum of Contemporary Art). the best work was in the basement past the Joan Miró costumes where they displayed Miriam Cahn, Robert Mapplethorpe, Francesca Woodman, Marina Abromovic, and others.
      <img src="june11.jpg" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;" width=500>
      <p style="max-width: 50em;">
        spent the rest of the day mostly on the roof reading and chatting with the nice cathedral view. also walked to good thai food and passed a chaotic marathon taking up the whole street complete with emcee and american house remixes to celebrate the finish line. the below video is of some motivational figures in attendance.

<h1>june 12</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 50em;">
          today started with a walk to Can Joan de S'Aigo, a cafe from 1700 that is largely preserved as it was with the same menu options. from there, a lazy Sunday walk towards downtown to find a cab. the cab ride was a 25 minute journey East to a little maarket nearby in the parking lot of an industrial area.
        <img src="june12.jpg" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;" width=500>
        <img src="june12.0.jpg" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;" width=500>
          <p style="max-width: 50em;">
            the town and surroundings were overwhelmingly barren and dry with buildings sparcely placed. the buildings outside of the market were on a gradient of historic preservation with newer looking renovations in some while others were totally frozen in time and had weeds and tall grasses spilling over the newly built sidewalks in front. the market had some good things, lots of old wood furniture and strange jerseys/clothing. inside the industrial park where it was held was a good looking antique store that picked lots of religious iconography and sculptures and dressers and chairs. we spent a long time wandering there and wishing we had more space in our backpacks. favorite things were a neon green road bike, a table with dead bugs pinned down and numbered inside, a cross display (pictured above), and a solid stained wood bird cage with ornate windows and spires.
      </p>
<h1>june 13</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 50em;">
      got breakfast, went to fancy, extensive, and rude store called Kling, visited Cathedral de Palma, and packed for the airport. the cathedral had heavenly light coming down from the stained glass above the pews. the inside was split up into separate friezes and sculptures guarded by stairs or fences along the entire perimiter. each of them were unmovable monuments that were enshrined in details and years of work. the front of the cathedral was thourough with two different worship altars on either side of the massive main altar. one, a very traditional and towering gold scene with sculptures of angels protecting those eating supper or wine and crackers. the other side was a more abstract, cracking, organic seascape covered in clay with different mosaics and figures poking out in repetition. the walls were obscured and the windows looked like they had smoke damage but the ground had nothing except beautifully simple marble benches on either side.
      <img src="june13.jpg" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;" width=500>
      <p style="max-width: 50em;">
        made it to cagliari, walked, bought perfect yellow pants, and ate around a nice circular plaza just below the Bastione di Saint Remy stairs. from the top you can see the port on the south of the city, the cargo ship docks and the wind farms beyond. i later learned that the wind turbines are next to the islands oil refinery as a governmental program to offset the emisions. it seems strange that they have to import oil to such a remote place for one singular purpose of refining and exporting. this was the view of the city from there.

<h1>june 14</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 50em;">
          spent the morning walking a bit until we arrived at a tailor to alter pants of yesterdays purchases. they didn't speak any english but we managed to express enough of what we needed done and hoped that they would understand and have them done before we left just two days later. from there we sought out the option of catching a taxi, or renting a moped, or a city bike. to our unpleasant surprise, either nothing we needed was open or we couldn't come across it. this meant we would walk to the beach which said it was 6 km away on maps and we had already been walking for quite some time.

          <p style="max-width: 50em;">
            we made it to a nice area by the water after stopping in a tiny and very friendly cafe. i enjoyed my first taste of lime San Carlo chips. they're great actually. i think they represent what most american chips would like to taste like but are simple and hit the right notes. we ate them on our walk to Poetto beach which turned into a walk towards the wrong direction and required some rigorous shortcuts. we eventually steered to where we were going and crossed the above bridge before arriving at what looked like an abandoned stadium. in the parking lot was a man riding a red motorcycle around a course of cones and another man parked on the sidewalk yelling "vamos" instructing him to speed up and slow down when he took turns or hit the straight away. we admired before continuing through a desolate and weeded parking lot back to the water and in the distance, i spotted some umberellas. this wasn't the beach we planned for but we found a semi private and local spot that was only 25 meters or so wide and had no less than 4 chihuahuas. the water was clear and we posted up on a blanket and got neon green mint flavored shaved ice while enjoying an afternoon at the beach.

                <p style="max-width: 50em;">
                  got up early today and walked to Marina del Sole to meet up with a man with a boat. his name was Andrea and he had beautiful curly hair and lived at sea on a boat named "Senza Vergogna", or shameless in English. he graciously invited us on to his sail boat and took us out while sharing common interests in music and photo. he has a photo show up in Cagliari now that aligns pictures with audio that he and his partner recorded on his boat. the recordings are his trumpet playing along with the ambience of the sea which he rigs up to be recorded while he works. he was generous in sharing his home and stories of growing up in Rome while also being somewhat of a tour guide. he smoothly brought us to a rugged rocky mountain and told us lore about how the rock formations came to be through the help of god's foot crushing the devil. he fed us the best olives i've ever had along with crackers and then brought out german beer and a feast. the picture is included in the "what i ate for dinner" tab at the top because it was a favorite meal. after serving us he dived into the water and paddle boarded to greet a friend docked beside us on the Ichnusa sponsored boat. its a Sardinian beer bought by Heineken that docks and hands out alcohol. he came back and we paddled out for a while before laying on the boat and enjoying afternoon espresso and cookies. we took the boat to Poetto and finally saw the longest beach on the island.

                  <p style="max-width: 50em;">
                    we spent the rest of the day on the boat, in and out of the water and taking in the sun. he shared more stories about the Italian mafia and why he hates that his girlfriend is moving to Paris. he was the best possible person to have met and spending the day on his boat became serene.

        got up early, retrieved clothes from the line on the porch, packed up, and got pistachio pastries. i'm on the plane now to Paris to meet some other soldiers, one of which has a mohawk. took a taxi from the airport and pulled up to an open door at a beautiful apartment (pictured below) with hummus in the fridge already and some champagne for our arrival.

      <p style="max-width: 50em;">
        we walked out in the Pigalle area for some coffee and orange juice when we passed this beautiful train shop that i loved. all the model trains were such detailed and well preserved objects just sitting in the window. we walked to meet up with a friend when jetlag hit within the group and we had to turn around for a nice bistro across the street from us that had lots of vegetarian options.
          </p>
          <h1>june 17</h1>
                <p style="max-width: 50em;">
                  we had a good breakfast down the street at a cafe called Marlette. then we commenced what would be an all day walk towards Le Marais. on the way seeing I.M. Pei's Louvre pyramid and some kilo shops before some famous green falafel and tight crowded streets. some stores had mostly weird and knock off merchandise but others had nice vintage clothing.

                <p style="max-width: 50em;">
                  in the evening i saw Place Vendome for the first time and the surrounding area just after walking the field at the Louvre. we saw a beautiful courtyard where the Comme Des Garcones store was located and got to spent some time in the store. it was one of my favorite stores i had visited so far on the trip because of how unassuming and sparce it was. the whole arrangement was just a rack or two of clothing in every area based on the clothing line and everything was in a large vertical alley. it was hot but the sun was setting and we went to the Ritz in the hope of finding an afternoon tea or snack because of all the walking we had done. we weren't so lucky because the dress code forbid me from wearing shorts and we did more walking before calling it for dinner. they had space at ferdi and we were close so i had the best cheesebburger i've ever had with a caesar salad. the restaurant was full of knicknacks and good character with the bathroom mimicing the rest of the space. there was something written on the mirror that looked like it said my name that's just above the coconuts in the above picture.
                    </p>
    <h1>june 18</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 50em;">
        walked in the morning to sit in a hot but beautiful cafe and stopped on the way to see a nearby cathedral. it was simple and ornate but the best part was the wicker chairs with very aged wood. afterwards, we spent some time exploring near Montmarte and found a small store by a French man named Marc le Bihan. everything was beautifully handmade and to enter the store you had to pass through a small stone garden on the ground. it was a strange buffer zone.
        <img src="june18.jpg" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;" width=500>

          <p style="max-width: 50em;">
            when back at the apartment, i hung all of the laundry on a pulley above the bath tub and took some pictures with the low hanging chaos. spent a lot of the day in and around there. the above picture is the kitchen in that beloved apartment lit up at night.
    </p>
    <h1>june 19</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 50em;">
        in the morning i made it up to Montemarte and saw the view near Sacre Coeur. there was a man covered in silver who stayed still mostly and i wasn't sure if he was real of sculpture because of where he was on top of a big banister. there were a lot fo great winding streets at the top of the mountain and to my surprise a lot of stores and restaurants. i thought it had been partitioned just for the cathedral but lots of life existed otherwise. the view in the below picture isn't actually from Montemarte, it's from the Pompidou later that afternoon.
        <img src="june19.jpg" style="display: block; margin-top: 16px;" width=500>

        <p style="max-width: 50em;">
          i loved the inside out architecture of the building and taking the escalator all the way to the top. the entrance looked a little like an overstimulated airport inside with a single bird picking up scraps in the cafeteria. on the top floor there was a Ray Charles exhibition which was great and pretty impressive. some of his large sculptures were just as impressive as his small ones inside of glass bottles. there was a single piece of wood carved into a human on a stretcher and a whole family scaled to the exact same height but keeping their proportions. one of my favorite pieces happened to be a self portrait that the photographer took of himself (pictured above). when i walked into that room that contained only the picture i thought that the walls on either side of me were curved when in fact, the picture, glass, and frame were all curved on a curved wall. this gave this illusion that other things were distorted but it was just the picture coming out towards the viewer. the rest of the top floor on the Pompidou contained some great photographs by August Sander and Otto Dix paintings. we spent some time there before meeting a new friend outside by the Louvre. on the walk home after dinner i liked looking at the spider webs on the bridge near Notre Dame.

    <p style="max-width: 50em;">
        today started with a prolonged picnic in the park just south of the Pantheon. it was prolonged because of how long it took to get groceries/snacks/sliced meat. everything was delicious of course and i took a bike from there to Galeries Lafayette. the below picture is the view looking up from the interior atrium and the below picture is looking down from the roof. it was scenic inside but so busy and nothing really caught my eye.

        <p style="max-width: 50em;">
          we walked from there to Palais Royal where we went through the park and arrived at the Rick Owens store. the chairs he designed and the vintage army cloth nailed down as carpet in there were my favorite. it was small and the first store he ever opened. they even had a wax figure of him as a tall monolithic figure dressed in his own clothes behind the cash register. we met a sweet Sweedish woman who was telling us about some of the clothes' stories and on our way out saw Rick Owens' wife, Michèle Lamy. she was a French socialite who is his muse and looked crazy to run into. we got back to the bed and breakfast and went for a dip in the cave like pool and sauna. got some dinner in the 6th and went to an underground bowling alley which felt like a low ceilinged bunker.

    <p style="max-width: 50em;">
        walked pretty much all morning/afternoon around the 6th starting down at the canal. there were some objects that were pulled out of the river along the side of the embankment including this motorcycle.

        after a croque madame i went to the Musée des Plans-Reliefs which was a museum of scale military models inside of a large 17th century compound in the 7th arrondissement. the shelter was called Hôtel des Invalides and today houses museums and historical archives. the models were massive and from hundreds of years ago but one of the stars of the show was the above model of Mont Saint-Michel. the whole room was pitch black besides the spot lights on the intricately textured surfaces. from there we met a new friend on the lawn of the eiffel tower and sat to chat for a while. from there we took a taxi to La Seine Musicale and crossed a rainbow colored bridge while the sun was starting to set. once inside of the venue, it looked like Brooklyn had overtaken the crowd as everyone was covered in sparce tattoos with shoulders exposed. it was a much more artsy and young crowd as we piled into a massive auditorium and sat down just as the lights dimmed. an orchestra and conductor came on stage with dramatic cold lighting followed by Bjork in an all silver, sequenced, and shaped suit with matching horns on her hat. she sounded good and carried the same voice thats in her recorded songs. highlights were come to me, hyperballad, hunter, bachlorette, and stonemilker. the below video is just before the encore.
